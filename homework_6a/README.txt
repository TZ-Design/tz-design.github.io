Description:
This is a project for PUI homework 6a and the project I chose is to create a website for Pittsburgh local pillow shop Fluff Stuff. You will find finished home page, shop page, the interactive product page for classic bed pillow, about page, and a (static) cart page. More interactivity coming soon to the cart page.
